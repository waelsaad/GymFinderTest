This application is created for test purposes for Loup created by Wael

The application fetches data from a url which receives a json file.

Display gyms near by user's location

Added a bonus detail view to display the location of the gym on map by converting address to coordinates

The application implements an MVVM design pattern which will read the json returned and renders the data .

The UI uses a UITableView and a Detail View

The UI implements AutoLayouts set up constraints

This project uses Xcode 9.2 and Swift 4

If there are any issues with the project please feel free to email me on wael.saad@hotmail.com or contact me on 0433 597 200
